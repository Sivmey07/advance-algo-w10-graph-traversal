Graph Traversal Using DFS and BFS

1. DFS (Depth-First Search)

The DFS algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses recursion to visit nodes.

Example:

Input: Graph with edges (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,5)

Start Node: 0

Output: 0 1 3 4 2 5

2. BFS (Breadth-First Search)

The BFS algorithm explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper. It uses a queue to process nodes level by level.

Example:

Input: Graph with edges (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,5)

Start Node: 0

Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5

Tasks

Implement DFS and BFS methods in C++.

Test both methods on a graph with 6 nodes and edges (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,5).

Verify that the output matches the provided examples.
